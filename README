Browser SSL Support Checker

The purpose of the Browser SSL Support Checker is to help users 
determine which SSL protocols (SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1) and ciphers
(from a long list) their web-browser supports.

To start, run check.sh from a Linux (or Cygwin) environment. The
script will start a number of OpenSSL processes, each listening
on a different port, and will create an HTML file that includes
IFrames to each process. 

When loading that HTML file, the IFrames that point to an OpenSSL
process that uses an unsupported cipher will cause an error and
will not load. 

JavaScript on the page will (does not currently) detect this and
show a summary page.

This project is looking for a host: If you have an Internet-accessible
server and are willing to run the OpenSSL processes, please contact
